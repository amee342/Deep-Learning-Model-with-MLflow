## END-TO-END DEEP LEARNING CONSTRUCTION

Given the characteristics of white wine, the software predicts its quality in range of 10.


## Table of Contents

- Run a hyperparameter sweep on a training script

- Compare the results of the runs in the MLflow UI

- Choose the best run and register it as a model (best-wine-quality model)

- Deploy the model to a REST API (future work)

- Build a container image suitable for deployment to a cloud platform (future work)

1. Hyperparameter Sweep

The investigated hyperparameters are learning rate and momentum. In the [notebook](starter.ipynb)
